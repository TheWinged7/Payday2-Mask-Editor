# Payday2-Mask-Editor
An attempt by me to create a program in unity to preview payday 2 masks customisations, including material, patten and colours.

at current, nothing is done while i learn c# and making programs in unity.
TO DO: 
  - locate all "materials" textures from the game files.
  - locate all "patterns" textures from the game files.
  - collect all colour combinations from the game.
  - add ability to apply a material, pattern and colour pair to a mask.
