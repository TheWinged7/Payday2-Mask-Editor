# Payday2-Mask-Editor
An attempt to create a program in unity to preview payday 2 masks customisations, including material, patten and colours.

at current, very little is done while i learn c# and making programs in unity.
CURRENTLY FINISHED:
  + 3 masks UV mapped and imported.
  + All base game masks found and exported, but not converted.
  + All base game material textures located and imported.
  + 12 patterns cleaned up.
  + ~~Simple switching between current list of masks, materials and patterns by key presses.~~
  +      Functions that take an int for the array address have replaced the above.
  + Added partialy functioning UI with the ability to switch between 2 masks at current functioning.
  

TO DO: 
  - locate all "materials" textures from the game files.
  - locate all "patterns" textures from the game files.
  - collect all colour combinations from the game.
  - add ability to apply a material, pattern and colour pair to a mask.
  - convert all masks to be .obj files instead of .model files
  - UV map all masks.
  - clean up all textures so they are all 2 solid colours + alpha.
  - work out how (if at all possible) to chroma-key pattern textures to match chosen colours.
  - if impossible to chroma-key pattern textures, make an individual pattern colouring for each of the colour combinations in game.
